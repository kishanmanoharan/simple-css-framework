# Simple CSS Framework

I built this for a school project, and decided to open source it. The `example.html` contains some of the working examples of how to use this framework.

Keep in mind that this is just a concept version and doesn't have very many features.

What is working:
- Grid
- Buttons
- Typography
- Cards
- Modals (sorta? Not very smooth)

Known issues:
- No way to expand or collapse the navigation bar on mobile. It is a little "buggy" with smaller screens.
- No form styling just yet, working on it.

### Setup:
You can include the minified version of the framework like this:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="simple-css-framework.min.css" />
```
The other files are just an "expanded" version of the framework with each file divided into it's own category.
Or if you like, the `simple-css-framework.css` file contains the "compiled" version of all of the files (note: this file is not minified)
